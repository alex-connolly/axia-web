<h2>Anonymity</h2>

The nature of a public, distributed ledger in which transactions may be verified by third-parties is at odds with the desire for personal anonymity when engaging in .

<h2>State of the Game</h2>

Several cryptocurrency protocols have provided mechanisms for the . ZCash's implementation,

<h2>zkSNARKs</h2>

Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zkSNARKs), are a mechanism for demonstrating that someone (the Prover) is in possession of some 'secret' knowledge, without revealing the content of this secret.

There are three primary steps .

Generate(Circuit, Random) => (Prover Key, Verification Key)
G(C, L) => (pk, vk)

P(pk, x, w) => prf

Verify()
V(vk, prf) => bool


<h2>Proof of Possession</h2>

When a transaction is sent from one party to another, it is only valid if the sender has the required balance to fund the payment.



In essence, this protocol requires a valid transaction to be accompanied by two elements:

<ul>
    <li>Proof of Ownership</li>
    <li>Proof of Uniqueness</li>
</ul>

The proof of ownership requirement is that the .

The uniqueness requirement is that this proof of ownership requirement has not been . Valid transactions to the chain must contain .
When verifying a transaction, the Verifier checks the chain for the cancellation. If it has been previously published, then while the Prover clearly owned the
currency at one point, they

<br>

It is thus possible for account-based transactions to be anonymous.
