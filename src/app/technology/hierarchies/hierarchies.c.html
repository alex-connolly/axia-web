<h2>Chain Hierarchies and Markets</h2>

Currently, protocols like Ethereum operate on a single blockchain, with all. While this is useful in one sense, as there is .
Significant portions of user-data stored on blockchain appplications does not need this longevity. Once the result of an election is finalised, for example, then while recording all the votes is a positive.
Of course, as storage space becomes more common, it is likely that the current uses of blockchain applications woul not become too strenous for most systems to handle. However, as
history has repeatedly shown, supply and demand are powerfully linked, and it is likely that any increases in storage space will be met by commensureate increased in data for storage.

The Axia protocol supports and encourages the development of a 'chain market', a place where blockchains can compete for validators by offering reward structures targeted to validators of different kinds.
Chains can set their own chain parameters:

- epoch length
- block reward
- transaction fee limits
- block size
- block time

This allows developers to make use of short-lived blockchains in their own applications.
