<h2>Smart Contracts</h2>

<h2>FireVM</h2>

Axia proposes a new virtual machine, which uses the central conceit of a fire to represent the computational energy consumed by the execution of smart contracts.

It was designed with heavy influence from Ethereum's virtual machine, and the bytecode it generates can be directly converted. This means that contracts which have been designed for the Ethreuem.

However, FireVM offers the following advantages:

- compressed contract call size
- faster run-time

For a detailed explanation of these features, see our wiki.

<h2>Guardian</h2>

Guardian is an entirely new smart-contracting programming language. It is object-oriented, statically typed, and draws inspiration from Java, Go and Solidity.
As there is a direct translation between FireVM and EVM bytecode, it is also possible to use Guardian to develop for that platform.

An example Guardian contract to create a new token (with unshielded transactions):
